        <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
        <img class="A1" src="CSS/A1.jpg" alt="pic">
        <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of<br>
          all time. Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the<br>
          development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of<br>
          modern physics. His massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed<br>
          "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He<br>
          received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of<br>
          the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. <br>His intellectual achievements and
           originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".

        <img class="A2"src="CSS/A2.jpg" alt="pic">
        <p class="para2">In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.<br>
           These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated<br>
            mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the <br>
            electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields;<br>
            he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity<br>
            to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to<br>
            his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, <br>
            which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors.<br>
            First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that nature "does not play dice".<br>
            Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism.<br>
             As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.
