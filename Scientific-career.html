       <img class="A4" src="CSS/A4.jpg" alt="pic">
      <p class="para2">Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more than 300<br>
        scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones. On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced<br>
        the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents. Einstein's intellectual<br>
        achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius". In addition to the<br>
        work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–<br>
        Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.

       <img class="A5" src="CSS/A5.PNG" alt="pic">
       <p class="para3">
         Einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It was published in 1901 with the title<br>
         "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers<br>
         he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These<br>
         papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as<br>
         firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on
                diffusion phenomena.

    <h3 class="jill">Theory of critical opalescence</h3>
    <img class="A6" src="CSS/A6.PNG" alt="pic">
    <p class="para4">
      Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density<br>
      variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second<br>
      derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading<br>
      to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making<br>
      the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the<br>
      fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein<br>
      quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how<br>
      both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.

     <h2>Special relativity</h2>
     <img class="A7" src="CSS/A7.PNG" alt="pic">

     <p class="para5">
       Einstein's "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper" ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905<br>
       and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and<br>
       magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. Observationally, the effects<br>
       of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light). The theory<br>
       developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity. There is evidence from Einstein's writings<br>
       that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Marić, on this work. The decision to publish only under his name seems to have<br>
       been mutual, but the exact reason is unknown. This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving<br>
       observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of<br>
       motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the<br>
       time—was superfluous. In his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E = mc2 as a consequence of his special<br>
       relativity equations. Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading<br>
       physicists, starting with Max Planck. Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving<br>
       bodies). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein<br>
       adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.
