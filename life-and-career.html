  Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March<br>
     1879 into a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and<br>
      engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle<br>
       Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical<br>
       equipment based on direct current.
</p>
<p>
  Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of<br>
    eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium),<br>
    where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire
    seven years later.
</p>
<p>
  In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting<br>
   because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the<br>
   more efficient alternating current (AC) standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In <br>
   search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. When<br>
   the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold <br>
    Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the<br>
    authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of <br>
    learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to<br>
    Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note. During <br>
    his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".

<p>
  Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers.<br>
   The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer.<br>
   Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12. <br>
   A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after<br>
   a short time "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics...<br>
    Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow." His passion for<br>
    geometry and algebra led the 12-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure".<br>
    Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus".<br>
</p>
<p>
  In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich<br>
   (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,<br>
   but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school, he attendedthe Argovian<br>
    cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling.While lodging with the family of professor <br>
    Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie.Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's son Paul. In January 1896, with his <br>
    father's  approval,Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service. In September <br>
    1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6.<br>
     At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who was a<br>
      year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.
